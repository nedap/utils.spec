Utilities for [clojure.spec](https://github.com/clojure/spec.alpha).

## Installation

Make sure `[spec-coerce "1.0.0-alpha9"]` (or similar) is present on the classpath if you want to use `nedap.util.spec.api/coerce-map-indicating-invalidity`. 

#### Coordinates

```clojure
[com.nedap.staffing-solutions/utils.spec "1.4.0"]
```

> Note that self-hosted ClojureScript (e.g. Lumo) is unsupported at the moment.

#### Production setup

* In JVM Clojure, set [`*assert*`](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/9981ae9086a352caf13a42bff4a7e43faa850452/sample.project.clj#L286) to `false`.

* In ClojureScript, set [`:elide-asserts`](https://clojurescript.org/reference/compiler-options#elide-asserts) to `true`.

## Documentation

Please browse the public namespaces, which are documented, speced and tested.

In case of a failure the `check!` macro will print an explanation and throw an exception. It's recommended not to swallow 
these exceptions and rely on exception reporting to discover failures.

It's possible to modify the spec-failure printing by setting `nedap.utils.spec.print-symbol` to any fully qualified symbol.

In cases where a `check!` spec-failure is printed, but the stacktrace is swallowed, one can debug the origin by setting 
the java property `nedap.utils.spec.print-stack-frames` to a positive number to print that amount of stackframes before 
the exception is raised.
